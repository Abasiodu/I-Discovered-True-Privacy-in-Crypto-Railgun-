# 🌐 Privacy in Crypto: Introducing Railgun

## 🔍 The Privacy Myth

One big myth is that privacy in crypto is only for bad actors. In reality, privacy is essential for many reasons:
- **Trade Secrets**: Keep your strategies confidential.
- **Salary Privacy**: Hide your earnings in crypto.

## 🔒 Current Privacy Challenges

Most blockchains are not designed for privacy. Public ledgers and tools like Chainalysis make tracking easier. Privacy-focused chains exist but come with limitations.
